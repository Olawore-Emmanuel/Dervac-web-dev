        <h1><b>BLACK ADAM</b></h1>

        <p>An entity with the power of the Gods is freed 
            from his prison and begins a campaign <br> to exact his revenge
            in Jaume Collet-Serra’s Black Adam.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a film that has reportedly been in the works for around 15 years. It’s a passion <br>
            project for Dwayne Johnson who has managed to use his star clout to convince Warner Bros. <br> 
            to invest in this so here we have Black Adam. The character started out as a <br>
            Captain Marvel -or Shazam!- villain but Dwayne Johnson’s involvement demands he be <br>
            the lead so the concept turns into an anti-hero story of sorts with Johnson playing the title <br>
            character becoming a hero on his own terms.
        </p>

            Dwayne Johnson is undoubtedly a massive star with whatever he appears in gaining <br>
            attention by virtue of his involvement. He is an actor with proven range as evidenced by <br>
            some of his earlier roles but in recent years he has been leaning on his star power and <br>
            turning in performances that are largely interchangeable. That combined with his physical <br>
            presence and very active public persona makes it difficult to see any of his roles as actual <br>
            characters as he fails to disappear into them. This is, of course, nothing new. Actors like <br>
            Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme etc made careers <br>
            out of being the tough action man at the centre of a film and audiences would be drawn to <br>
            what they were guaranteed to bring to the table. Johnson is almost the modern equivalent,  <br>
            though this film does signify a departure from his typical cinema persona.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oddly, Johnson departing from his standard persona is one of the things that lets this film  <br>
            down. Teth Adam -as he is known early on- is not an emotive character which means that  <br>
            Johnson doesn’t get to make use of his charisma. There is an emotional story behind Teth <br>
            Adam that the film delivers but Johnson’s performance is so deliberately one-note that it <br>
            doesn’t land in the way that it needs to. It does suit the character as a relentless <br>
            vengeance-driven engine of destruction but there’s an emotional disconnect between what <br>
            the audience is told about the character and how he expresses how he feels about it that <br>
            makes it difficult to connect with.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teth Adam is the least interesting character the film has to offer. His backstory is <br>
            something the film takes a lot of time to flesh out and the script plays with how time and <br>
            perspective alter historic events in mildly interesting ways but without a strong emotional <br>
            connection to the eventual clarification, it falls flat. The rest of the time Teth Adam is an <br> 
            unstoppable force with no equal who becomes a folk hero because a lot of his rage is <br> 
            turned on those oppressing a Middle Eastern country. The film aggressively repeats Teth <br> 
            Adam being challenged, declaring how powerful he is and then proving how powerful he <br>
            is. It very quickly becomes frustrating seeing him engage in countless fights he has <br> 
            absolutely no chance of losing. A couple of weaknesses are established but never made <br>  
            proper use of.
