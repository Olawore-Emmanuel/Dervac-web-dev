<dd align ="center">
     Claimed as one of their own throughout North Africa and the Middle East,<br> 
     untangling the web of where shakshuka is from is simply impossible. <br>
     All we know is that it's an incredibly tasty and filling dish that's become a popular breakfast and brunch meal throughout the world. <br>
     Literally translating as a mixture, it's usually cooked by reducing down tomatoes,<br>
     onions and a range of spices before the eggs are poached on top. <br>

<dt align="center"><b>Moules Marinières</b></dt>
<dd align="center">
    This French dish from the west of France can be made in about 15 minutes. <br>
    It’s made with fresh, inexpensive ingredients and is great for dipping bread since the mussels produce a briny liquid when cooked. <br>
     To make this dish, remove the mussels immediately after cooking and finish the dish with butter, parsley, lemon juice and either mayonnaise or crème fraiche. <br>
     You’re left with a rich, creamy sauce that only took 15 minutes to make!
